hello im some dude from germany creating his github account,
I first coded in the most impractical programming languages 
at the age of 13 and I never really got a hang out of it (that part was in middle school).
So I just ignored CS until I was like 16/17 when I again started "programming" in HTML/CSS
(I know those 2 aren´t programming languages). And then I got interested in Python which was
the first time I coded fully by myself. I then used a few other languages Java(bc of high school)
and R (which I completely forgot at this point because I never used it in any practical way).
Then sucessfully dropped out of high school and then signed up for the most stupid degree,
which I absolutely regret. And now I´m applying for a pure CS one, which I think is better,
way better.

So yeah I do have a little bit of experience, but I feel like I do not.
So yeah whatever and now I´m creating this account. really cool
